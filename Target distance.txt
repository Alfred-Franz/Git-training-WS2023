Worksheet 2 „Measuring the error of a puncture experiment“ Practical course: Software Development for Medical Navigation Systems Prof. Alfred Franz (alfred.franz@thu.de) Preparation 1) Open the provided CT datasets "CT-Example-dataset.nrrd" and "CT-sample-dataset2.nrrd" with MITK. 2) Compare the data sets. The same animal can be seen, what has changed? Segmentation of target structures 3) In the liver of the animal you will find several artificial targets enriched with contrast agent. Segment these targets in CT-sample-dataset2.nrrd each as a separate object ("Target 1", "Target 2", etc.) using the "Segmentation" view. For example, you can segment layer by layer by hand or use "3D Region Growing". Feel free to try different methods. 4) Convert the targets to polygon models by right click on the objects in the "data manager" view. Save the targets individually as stl files. Measuring the puncture error 5) Locate the tip of the inserted needle in the CT (CT-sample-dataset2.nrrd). Measure the distance of the tip to the center of the nearest target structure. 6) For measuring the distance in 3D there are e.g. the following possibilities a. You rotate a 2D plane so that the target center and the needle tip are visible in the same plane (click on the small cross in the upper right corner of the plane and activate "Crosshair rotation"). Then you can use the "Measurement" view to measure the distance. b. You use the view "Pointset Interaction" and define 2 new points: The center of the target and the tip of the needle. In the view "Properies" you can now activate "Show distances" for the pointset - the distance will be displayed in the renderwindows at the corresponding position. 7) Save the measured distance in mm to a text file named "Puncture Error.txt".  Submission of results: Put the stl files of the targets together with the measured distance in a zip file and submit it in Moodle.
